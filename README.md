# FairDiverseDPPSampling
This repository provides an implementation in python of a fair and diverse sampling mechanism based on DPPs (Determinantal Point Processes) along with experiments comparing several exising sampling methods as presented in our ICML'18 paper (available here https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04023).


### Using the code

1. If you want to see a simple demonstration of DPP sampling see "example_sampling.py". 
1. If you want to run the experiments using the image data-set run "run_image_experiment.py".
1. If you want to run the experiments using the adult data-set run "run_adult_experiment.py".
